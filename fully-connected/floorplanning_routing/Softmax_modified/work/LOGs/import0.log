info running report region utilization in global placement context: 
    - utilization = (mobile_cell_area/(row_area - obstruction_area)).
    - obstruction area include hard and soft blockages, fixed std cells, fixed macros and pads.
    - by default, cell area include all bloats associated with the cells. 


info  report_region_utilization is restricted to regions with property member_hard set to TRUE.
